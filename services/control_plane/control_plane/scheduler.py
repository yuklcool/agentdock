"""Background sweep that fires due scheduled tasks.

Registered in app.py's lifespan via _bg_loop. Each tick claims every schedule
whose next_run_at has elapsed (FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED), advances their next_run_at
in a single committed "claim" transaction, then fires each claimed task — either
by submitting a prompt task via submit_task_core (prompt target) or starting a
workflow run via start_run (workflow target, with overlap guard).

Claim-then-fire ordering matters: once a row's next_run_at is advanced and
committed, it is no longer due, so neither a crash mid-submit nor a second
control-plane replica can re-fire the same slot. Because the claim commit happens
before any submit, releasing the SKIP LOCKED row locks is harmless — every claimed
row is already in the future.
